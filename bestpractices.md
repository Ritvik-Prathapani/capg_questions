Writing efficient Python code requires following best practices to reduce execution time. Here are some key techniques:  

---

### **1. Use Built-in Functions and Libraries**  
Python's built-in functions are optimized in C, making them faster than custom implementations.  
```python
# Instead of a loop for summing numbers
sum_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = sum(sum_list)  # Faster than using a loop
```

---

### **2. Use List Comprehensions Instead of Loops**  
List comprehensions are faster than traditional loops.  
```python
# Instead of
squares = []
for i in range(10):
    squares.append(i * i)

# Use
squares = [i * i for i in range(10)]
```

---

### **3. Use Generator Expressions for Large Data**  
Generators are memory efficient and reduce execution time.  
```python
# Instead of creating a list
squares = (i * i for i in range(10**6))  # Uses less memory than a list
```

---

### **4. Use `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()` for Functional Programming**  
```python
from functools import reduce

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Use map instead of looping for applying functions
squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, nums))

# Use filter for conditions
evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums))

# Use reduce for cumulative operations
product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, nums)
```

---

### **5. Avoid Unnecessary Loops (Vectorization with NumPy)**  
Instead of looping over elements, use NumPy for numerical operations.  
```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
squared_arr = arr ** 2  # Faster than looping through the array
```

---

### **6. Use Sets and Dictionaries for Fast Lookups**  
Sets and dictionaries provide O(1) lookup time compared to lists (O(n)).  
```python
items = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
if 3 in items:  # Faster than checking in a list
    print("Found")

# Dictionary lookup
data = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
value = data.get('b', 0)  # Efficient way to access keys
```

---

### **7. Use `join()` Instead of Looping for String Concatenation**  
String concatenation inside loops is slow due to immutable strings.  
```python
# Instead of
words = ["Hello", "world", "!"]
sentence = ""
for word in words:
    sentence += word + " "  # Inefficient

# Use join
sentence = " ".join(words)
```

---

### **8. Use `multiprocessing` or `threading` for Parallelism**  
For CPU-bound tasks, use multiprocessing. For I/O-bound tasks, use threading.  
```python
from multiprocessing import Pool

def square(n):
    return n * n

with Pool(4) as p:
    results = p.map(square, range(10))
```

---

### **9. Use `lru_cache` for Caching Expensive Function Calls**  
```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

---

### **10. Avoid Global Variables**  
Global variables slow down variable lookup. Instead, pass them as arguments.  

---

To execute Python code faster without using loops, you can use the following alternatives:  

---

### **1. List Comprehensions (For Faster Iteration)**  
List comprehensions are optimized in C and execute faster than `for` loops.  
```python
# Instead of using a loop
squares = []
for i in range(10):
    squares.append(i ** 2)

# Use list comprehension
squares = [i ** 2 for i in range(10)]
```

---

### **2. `map()` Function (For Element-wise Operations)**  
`map()` applies a function to each element in an iterable without using explicit loops.  
```python
# Instead of looping
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_nums = []
for num in nums:
    squared_nums.append(num ** 2)

# Use map
squared_nums = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, nums))
```

---

### **3. `filter()` Function (For Conditional Filtering)**  
`filter()` is optimized for filtering elements based on a condition.  
```python
# Instead of looping
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_nums = []
for num in nums:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        even_nums.append(num)

# Use filter
even_nums = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums))
```

---

### **4. `reduce()` Function (For Cumulative Operations)**  
`reduce()` is useful for cumulative operations like sum, product, etc.  
```python
from functools import reduce

# Instead of looping
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = 0
for num in nums:
    total += num

# Use reduce
total = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, nums)
```

---

### **5. Vectorization Using NumPy (For Mathematical Operations)**  
NumPy is much faster than Python loops for numerical computations.  
```python
import numpy as np

# Instead of looping
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_arr = []
for num in arr:
    squared_arr.append(num ** 2)

# Use NumPy
arr_np = np.array(arr)
squared_arr = arr_np ** 2
```

---

### **6. Using Set and Dictionary Comprehensions**  
Similar to list comprehensions, set and dictionary comprehensions are faster than loops.  
```python
# Set comprehension
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_set = {num ** 2 for num in nums}

# Dictionary comprehension
squared_dict = {num: num ** 2 for num in nums}
```

---

### **7. Using Pandas for Data Processing**  
Pandas can efficiently handle large datasets without explicit loops.  
```python
import pandas as pd

# Instead of looping through a list
data = {'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Apply function to column
df['A_squared'] = df['A'].apply(lambda x: x ** 2)
```

---

### **8. Using Generators (For Memory Efficiency in Large Iterations)**  
Generators avoid storing large data in memory.  
```python
# Instead of a list
squared_gen = (i ** 2 for i in range(10**6))  # Uses less memory
```

---

### **9. Using `lru_cache` for Recursion Optimization**  
Memoization reduces redundant calculations in recursion.  
```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

---
