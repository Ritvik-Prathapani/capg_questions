1. **PEP 8 Compliance**

    - Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
    - Limit lines to 79 characters to improve readability.
    - Use lowercase for variable names, and use underscores to separate words (snake_case).
    - Use uppercase for constants.
    - Use spaces around operators and after commas.

    ```python
    # Good practice (PEP 8 compliant)
    def calculate_average(numbers):
        total = sum(numbers)
        average = total / len(numbers)
        return average

    # Avoid (not PEP 8 compliant)
    def CalculateAverage(numbers):
        Total = sum(numbers)
        AVERAGE = Total / len(numbers)
        return AVERAGE
    ```

2. **Meaningful Variable Names**

    Choose meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. This improves code readability and reduces the need for comments.

    ```python
    # Good practice
    def calculate_rectangle_area(length, width):
        area = length * width
        return area

    # Avoid
    def calc_area(a, b):
        res = a * b
        return res
    ```

3. **Avoid Magic Numbers**

    Magic numbers are hard-coded numeric literals without any explanation. Instead, use named constants or variables with descriptive names to enhance code readability.

    ```python
    # Good practice
    PI = 3.14159
    radius = 5
    circumference = 2 * PI * radius

    # Avoid
    circumference = 2 * 3.14159 * 5
    ```

4. **List Comprehensions and Generators**

    List comprehensions and generators are Pythonic ways to create lists and iterators, respectively. They provide a concise and efficient way to work with collections.

    ```python
    # Good practice (List comprehension)
    squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(1, 11)]

    # Good practice (Generator)
    even_numbers = (x for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0)
    ```

5. **Error Handling with Try-Except Blocks**

    Always handle exceptions using try-except blocks to prevent the program from crashing when encountering errors.

    ```python
    # Good practice
    try:
        result = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
    ```

6. **Avoid Using Global Variables**

    Global variables can lead to code that is difficult to reason about and debug. Instead, use function arguments and return values to pass data between functions.

    ```python
    # Good practice
    def calculate_total_price(prices):
        total = sum(prices)
        return total

    # Avoid
    total = 0

    def calculate_total_price(prices):
        global total
        total = sum(prices)
    ```

7. **Commenting and Documentation**

    Document your code using clear and concise comments. Well-documented code is easier to maintain and understand.

    ```python
    # Good practice (Function with docstring)
    def greet(name):
        """
        Greets the user with the given name.

        Parameters:
            name (str): The name of the user.

        Returns:
            str: A greeting message.
        """
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

    # Avoid (No comments)
    def greet(name):
        return f"Hello, {name}!"
    ```
